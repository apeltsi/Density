# Density
### What is it?
Density is a web framework for drawing simple shapes and sprites for any project. But Density can be very powerful.

### Getting Started
As Density is still a WIP project it is recommended to download/clone the src folder for a quick start. You can use the density-builder tool (alpha) to minimize all of the JS in your project and make a production build.

### TODO
- Webpack support
- Update cluster renderer for 2.0
